1). now once we detect our object we need to first create a filter so we are
only taking objects that are bigger than a certain area and then we need to
define a way in which we can save our images once we are getting our number
plate. so the first thing we will do is add our filter.
2). then we can extract our ROI(Region Of Interest) i.e our number plate. so,
once we have our rectangle with x,y,width(w) and height(h) we can use this
information to get our number plate image.
